# SHOPIFY_PRODUCTION_ENGINEER
The repository for the Production Engineer Internship challenge for Shopify

The main file to run the program is production_engineer.py. 

The other modules in the production_engineer_intern folder are modules created by me.

The run button has been programmed to work, and has work in testing, however; should something fail, then the program can also be run by typing the following into the console:

  - cd production_engineer_intern
  - python production_engineer.py

By default, the 5 cities generated are:

  - Toronto, Canada
  - Rome, Italy
  - Amsterdam, Netherlands
  - Berlin, Germany
  - Boston, US

In testing, both Rome and Toronto have been changed to Giza, Egypt, and Salvador, Brazil respectively. 

At the moment, a personal API key is being used from openweathermap.org. Depending on when this program is run, the key could be disabled for privacy and security reasons. 

Features that could be added would be holding stock information, images, and city descriptions. 

Also, certain parts of the main code could have been put into a separate module/methods in order to help readability and improve security.
